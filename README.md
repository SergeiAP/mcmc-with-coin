# Description

Play with fair/unfair coin using Bayes theorem and Monte-Carlo Markov Chain.

__Goal:__   
* Investigate [`PyMC`](https://www.pymc.io/welcome.html) library
* To play with `Bayes theorem`, `Monte-Carlo Markov Chain`, prior and posterior distribution

__Plan:__   
* Create coin model in PyMC.
* Plot prior distribution.
* Play with posterior distribution depending on coin heads number in an experiment.   

Coin model consists of head-tails probability distribution and heads ("success") number distribution in experiment series.
